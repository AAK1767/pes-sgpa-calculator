## 📖 User Guide

### Tab Overview

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Subjects** | Enter marks, configure subjects, load presets |
| **Analysis** | View predictions, grade requirements, smart strategy |
| **Reverse Calc** | Set target SGPA → get required ESA scores |
| **Priority** | ROI-based study recommendations |
| **CGPA** | Calculate cumulative GPA across semesters |
| **Guide** | In-app help and documentation |

### Quick Start

1. **Load a Preset** (Subjects Tab)
   - Click the dropdown → Select "Chemistry Cycle" or "Physics Cycle"
   
2. **Enter Your Marks**
   - Click on any subject to expand
   - Enter ISA1, ISA2, Assignment, Lab, ESA scores
   - Scores auto-save as you type

3. **Check Analysis**
   - Go to Analysis tab to see predictions
   - View "Safe" ESA scores needed for each grade

4. **Plan Your ESAs**
   - Go to Reverse Calc tab
   - Set your target SGPA (e.g., 9.0)
   - See exactly what you need in each subject

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl + Z` | Undo |
| `Ctrl + Y` | Redo |
| `Ctrl + S` | Export data |
| `Escape` | Close expanded subject |

### Understanding "Momentum"

When you leave a field empty (like ISA2), most calculators treat it as 0. This app uses **Momentum Scoring**:

- If you scored 35/40 in ISA1 → We assume similar performance in ISA2
- This gives realistic predictions before exams are written
- Look for the "Using Momentum" warning in Reverse Calc

### Custom Colleges (VTU, IIT, etc.)

1. Go to **Subjects Tab**
2. Click **"Not from PES? 🎓"**
3. Configure:
   - Assessment components (Midterms, Finals, Labs, etc.)
   - Weights for each component
   - Grading scheme (choose preset or custom)
4. Click **Create Subject**

## 📊 Grading Logic

### Default PES Scheme

| Grade | Min Score | Grade Points |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| S | 90 | 10 |
| A | 80 | 9 |
| B | 70 | 8 |
| C | 60 | 7 |
| D | 50 | 6 |
| E | 40 | 5 |
| F | 0 | 0 |

### SGPA Formula

```
SGPA = Σ(Grade Points × Credits) / Σ(Credits)
```

### 5-Credit Course Scaling

PES 5-credit courses have 120% total weightage:
- ISA1: 20%, ISA2: 20%, Assignment: 10%, Lab: 20%, ESA: 50%
- Total: 120% → Normalized to 100% in final calculation
